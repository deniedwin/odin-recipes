<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This leftover ham bone lentil soup is one of the tastiest soups 
    we have ever had! So much flavor packed into one bowl. YUM!
</p>

<p>
    If you have a leftover ham bone, this soup is a must-make. 
    And if you don't have a leftover ham bone, run to the meat or 
    butcher section of your friendly grocery store and grab a ham hock. It'll work just as well.
</p>

<p>
    Lentils can get a bad rep for being a little, well, boring. 
    But rest assured that there is nothing boring about this soup. It is hearty, wholesome, and packed with flavor.

<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 cup diced onion (1 medium onion)</li>
    <li>1 cup diced celery (2-3 ribs)</li>
    <li>1 cup diced carrots (2-3 medium carrots)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley (or 1/4 cup fresh)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced (or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder)</li>
    <li>pinch crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>8 cups chicken stock or broth (I use low-sodium)</li>
    <li>1 pound brown lentils (about 2 1/4 cups), rinsed and picked through/small debri and stones removed</li>
    <li>1 dried bay leaf</li>
    <li>1 leftover ham bone or smoked ham hock</li>
    <li>1 pound Italian chicken or pork sausages (fully cooked), sliced or chopped</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>In a 6- or 8-quart pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, carrots, parsley, thyme, garlic, 
        and crushed red pepper (if using), and cook, stirring often, until the veggies start to soften, 3-4 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the broth, lentils, bay leaf, and the ham bone or ham hock (it may not be fully submerged, that's ok). 
        Bring the soup to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and continue to simmer for 45-60 
        minutes, until the lentils are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and moderate the heat if you need to.
    </li>
    <li>
        While the soup cooks, brown the sausages with a bit of olive oil in a skillet set over medium 
        heat (optional: you can leave the sausages out entirely or throw them in the soup without 
        browning but I like the flavor and texture from browning them first).
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the ham bone, and if desired, pick off any pieces of ham and add to the soup with 
        the browned sausage. Heat through.
    </li>
    <li>
        Season to taste with salt and pepper (this is important! Additional salt is not included in the recipe to 
        account for varying saltiness in different varieties of ham and broth, so make sure to 
        add to taste or the soup may be bland).
